This will be Malani's first exhibition in India after becoming the first Indian artist to win the celebrated Joan Miro Prize. The solo expands on Malani's history with the Institut - in 1993, Malani worked on a collaboration on German dramatist Heiner Mueller's Medeamaterial (with Alaknanda Samarth), and later on Bertolt Brecht's The Job in 1995.

=500  \\$a"Liminal, Savia Mahajan's first solo exhibition at TARQ, explores through a variety of mediums - including sculpture, drawing and installation - notions of life, death and the in-between. While Mahajan's sculptures use conventional pottery materials, including ceramic, porcelain, paper and clay, she also experiments with chemicals such as cobalt, iron oxide and even gold in her detailed sculptures. With these materials, she creates a vast range of objects, from fossils to books, to a series of shape-shifting objects. Also included in the exhibition are Savia's intricate drawings on recycled paper, which mirror her preoccupations with detail, nuance and material. Conceptually, she embarks on a journey that explores the 'in-between' state that rests between the eternal polarities of life and death. She plays with the idea of the universality of the 'liminal' space that transcends religion and exists as a profound spiritual truth. As a ceramicist and obsessive collector, Savia has collected a number of urns that are used across cultures to store the remains of the dead. As part of the series, "beginning - end - beginning" she uses these to deeply question our very existence as particles on the earth, bringing together a complex thread of thought, best articulated by Professor K. Sridhar. In his essay on the show, he says, "Liminal wants us to return to a mode of art which chose to address primordial questions. It moves away from the questions that dominate public life; indeed, it asks what happens to those questions when they are confronted by death and dissolution. It returns to the age-old, probably never-to-be-answered, question of whether there exists anything other than the body which survives death... When the book burns with the clay in the furnace, what does it leave behind? This is the question that Liminal forces us to face head-on."" -- TARQ web site.

=500  \\$a"Notorious Rowdies - a series of performative photographs by Clare Arni marks Arni's third solo exhibition at TARQ. The term 'rowdy' has a particularly evocative quality in South India. The 'rowdy' is an unsavoury character, an outlaw, with a strangely alluring bravado. Clare Arni's fascination with the figure of the 'rowdy' began a few years ago while scouring the crime beat section of a local daily, the Deccan Herald. This captivating section carried sordid tales of the nefarious activities of local gangsters, many of whom carried cryptic and outlandish aliases like Dairy, Chicken and JCB. The crime beat section and its sensationalist reportage style was for Arni, an echo of the garish aesthetic of film posters that are plastered across Bangalore, the city she calls home. The posters glamorized violence, with larger than life characters in incredulous scenarios. Fascinated by the specific persona of the 'rowdy', Arni began toying with the idea that perhaps there is a violence and drama in all of us; a rowdy under the surface, waiting to leap out. She began her project by photographing friends - fellow artists and writers - in various modes of the 'rowdy'. The participants were asked to delve into the inner life of the rowdy they had chosen to embody, creating elaborate back stories and crime sheets. What began as a fun project has turned into a series of performative photographs that are simultaneously humorous and macabre, with an aesthetic reminiscent of a low budget film. They unearth the dark fantasies of the subjects while also serving as a mirror to the universal voyeuristic fascination with violence. The exhibition is accompanied by a text by Zac O'Yeah - an author and one of Clare's first "Rowdies."" -- TARQ web site.

=500  \\$a"One day it will come out by Baroda based Soghra Khurasani is the artist's first solo show. This exhibition looks into her complex practice, which revolves around her visceral reaction to the political and religious realities of being in India today. She keeps returning to the imagery of blood cells in her work, and thus systematically blurs the lines between powerful emotions and biological reality. The display includes several forms of printmaking as well as new media work, through which the artist is able to explore and express ideas of beauty and violence, using an incredible attention to detail. Her print works include the use of the woodcut, etching and serigraphy techniques. We are delighted to be able to display some of Soghra's wood blocks, from which she has made the prints on display, as these are artworks in their own right, and are essential to understanding the artist's process. The body of work is accompanied by a catalogue published in collaboration with the Clarke House Initiative, featuring an essay by Sumesh Sharma, who has been closely involved with Soghra's practice." -- TARQ web site.

=500  \\$a"Tanmoy Samanta's second solo exhibition at TARQ, Portraits in Time, carries works created by the artist over the last two years. In keeping with his distinctive aesthetic of clean lines and muted, stone-like colours, Samanta has continued to use a motley collection of found objects - protractors, stencils, pins and a faux fur in his work, which, together with his tempera and mixed media allow a turn towards the uncanny and surreal. Samanta uses portraiture - a theme steeped in historical tradition - in order to delve into time and its impact on memory and recall. The portraits, which individually define their specific subjects, envelop seemingly inconsequential and banal objects in a much wider context. The objects become "witnesses"; receptacles of memories that travel through the folds of time and space. Samanta imbues the uncanny imagery with symbolism that travels from the universe of the frame to the field of vision of the viewer. In her insightful essay on Portraits in Time, Veranganakumari Solanki Jamwal says - "Through this series of portraits, Samanta creates an acceptance of looking at portraiture in a non-traditional manner. He experiments with medium and brings forward icons of time to re-characterise them in a contemporary context. In his works, they depict life, character, thoughts and metaphors."" -- TARQ website.

Presented in collaboration with Blueprint 12 (New Delhi) and Colombo Art Biennale (Colombo), Reading Room is a show curated by Amit Jain, featuring works by fifteen artists from across the world. The ‘Reading Room’ is a journey of discoveries and experiences, of nostalgia and witness; a space where the many and varied perspectives and practices of the book arts find a place of meeting, dialogue and expression. Book art demands both, an aesthetic engagement and critical conceptual inquiry into the work. Aesthetic engagement with book art requires a paradigm shift to reading a different logic in the book: the logic of the visual, textural and cultural. Traditionally, the book has signified knowledge, and can be considered a visually embedded cultural site because of this history (consider the many times that books have been burnt as acts of symbolic violence). It is a site where many versions of history, senses of identity and narratives (both dominant and counter) converge. The book in contemporary art, is thus an object completely transformed – not just in its structure, but also in its meaning. Walter Benjamin calls this the ‘renewal of existence.’ This sense of renewal is to be experienced in the work of the exhibiting artists brought together in conversation in the ‘Reading Room’. The mood is sometimes fantastical and playful, and sometimes evocative and intimate. At its most activist, it stands as a collective resistance to dominant politics and ideologies. And, as the artist, in many ways, works as an interpreter of the book, so will the viewer of the work. The experience of reading is deeply personal, whether approached with anticipation, curiosity, or sometimes even with hesitation. Thus, the ‘Reading Room’ invites the reader of this space to carry with them the memory of this experience in a context created for encounter, discussion, and making meaning." -- TARQ web site.

=500  \\$a"The team at TARQ is delighted to present 'YOU ARE ALL CAUGHT UP' by Sameer Kulavoor. This is his second solo exhibition at TARQ. The show is made up of a series of paintings and drawings that are an expression of the artist's understanding of the tumultuous historical moment that we are currently experiencing. In this show, Kulavoor continues to be fascinated with Social Media, and looks deeply at ideas of the personal and political through the ubiquitous blue screen. While the artist has in some ways continued his unique observations of urban spaces - the landscape he is intimately familiar with - he now looks at these regular haunts through the lens of the growing pandemic. In this, he grows curiouser and curiouser as to how and why people adapt to the times by consuming content that is now readily available at your fingertips, and often times, leads to an information overload. In many ways, his works are a documentation of life not only in an urban metropolis but the restless mental state of living through a time of political turmoil. As a sign of the times, it is not uncommon to find the omnipresent cell phone in several works, serving to alienate, entertain and often, making the private, public. Kulavoor continues to question and dissect how humanity, as a whole, is adapting to and fighting against these unchartered territories seeking change." -- TARQ web site.

=500  \\$a"An exhibition of recent works by Sonia Mehra Chawla, Scapelands examines the development of the artist's strategies that unsettle conventional wisdom about our relationship with and within nature and take on a notion of turning inwards into a phenomenological experience of life. Based on her navigations in the Sunderbans in West Bengal and Pichavaram in Tamil Nadu, both biomes of mangroves; the forests of Uttarakhand; fallen boughs in Goa and Pondicherry; and a riverbank in Thailand, Chawla engages with the natural and organic world -- a result of several years of research and documentation of sites across geographies. Her creative process involves working intimately with various mediums: painting, printmaking, photography and video. As an artist-in-residence at the London Print Studio in the UK in 2014, she experimented with photopolymer gravure, a form of non-toxic intaglio printmaking, which is elemental to the works displayed in this exhibition. Chawla's artistic practice is concerned with the construction of nature that is defined not just as the physical world around us but also the conditions of our physical, metaphorical, social and ecological interactions with it. Drawing inspiration from the tropes of germination, gestation, ecotopia and science fiction, she explores spaces, and the articulation of human experiences within these spaces -- both inner and outer. Through her practice, she endeavors to transform everyday earthly images into phantasmagorical visions, landscapes that could be from the earth's primordial past or vistas from distant planetary surfaces we are yet to encounter. Evolution through dynamic growth and metamorphosis is fundamental to the imagery in Chawla's works."

=500  \\$a"Sri Sri Lanka, Pala Pothupitiye's first solo exhibition in India at TARQ, primarily features a suite of Pala's celebrated maps, on both paper and canvas. This exhibition explores the process of re-crafting the 'official' version of maps as a consequence of the underlying geopolitics that are in constant flux and that have changed throughout Asia's historical evolution. Each map delves into Sri Lanka's rich historical past, and with each map, the artist attempts to decode another aspect of the nation's fraught identity. The artist works with maps carefully modifying and manipulating the image of Sri Lanka that is familiar to the viewer in its conventional form, but in this case has morphed beyond recognition. "Sri Sri Lanka" will also include a set of sculptures that further examine the post-colonial Sri Lankan identity, through the lens of the artist. It is through these maps and sculptures that the exhibition provides an insight to the politically biased, and often subjective notions of map-making. It is also perhaps the case that the scars of colonialism and religious conflicts demand that Sri Lanka re-looks at herself, in this case, through the eyes of a cartographer who questions his own traditional as well as academic upbringing in a politically-charged nation that, from his artistic vantage point, fails to address the venerated title -- 'Sri' --the country is known for." -- TARQ web site.

=500  \\$a"Stained Geographies, Saju Kunhan's first solo exhibition at TARQ, brings together a body of work that is the result of Kunhan's exploration of the archive along with the re-interpretation of images in shifting contexts. He uses wood and archival images to articulate his conceptual investigations. Accompanied by an essay penned by architect and researcher Anuj Daga, Saju's exhibition catalogue highlights the spectacular variation in scale that Saju is able to execute. His works range from small scale multimedia drawings of cityscapes to immense multi-panel works that use image transfers onto wood to depict maps and large-scale migrations from city to city, and indeed across the world. By working with maps and spaces, Saju creates a mythical, almost fantasy world, that prompts questions of where we are, how we got there, and where will go from here. According to Anuj Daga, "Movement, collisions, ruffles and stains give meaning to life in Saju's works. Staining is an active process that enables our engagement with history. And it is through such engagement that we are able to define distinct geographies - physical as well as cultural. What shall be the shape of the world as seen through the extents of such engagements? The works presented in this selection invite us to live the space between the finished and the incomplete. It paints a possibility in the life of a stain that gains definition in its fading, or one that learns to fades in its firmness. Saju's geographies reconcile stains into shades of landscapes that have accumulated meaning over a slow process of history. It gestures to the stained geographies we all eventually come to inhabit."" -- TARQ web site.

=500  \\$a"Curated by Ranjit Hoskote, The Shadow Trapper’s Almanac, is Tanmoy Samanta’s first solo exhibition in Bombay. It features gouache paintings on rice paper and recycled book sculptures, two integral facets of his practice. Samanta’s practice explores notions traditionally associated with sculpture, including “volume and void, relief and surface, container and content". In Samanta’s delicate works on paper, we find elements of cutout and collage reminiscent of Surrealist and Dada practices as well as a nuanced surety that echoes the style of the miniature. Samanta begins a painting by layering rice paper onto a thicker base, using a series of colours going from dark to light. His book works explore various types of books, including the kitab, the muraqqa, and the laporetto. Each book engages the viewer’s imagination in a unique way. Samanta’s use of desaturated colour and texture evokes a sense of rich nostalgia in the ordinary. According to Hoskote, “Tanmoy Samanta’s works, with their combination of exhilaration and menace, formal playfulness and philosophical depth, remind us that art is not an escape from the world, but a route that leads us back, replenished by dream and vision, to the perplexities of the everyday.”" -- TARQ web site.

In this exhibition, Sikander expands on her growing practice of looking at and recreating various species from nature, some real and some imagined. The artist uses layer upon layer of intricately cut out paper to create form after form of moths, mantises and birds, each one meticulously assembled in her studio in Murud-Janjira. This exhibition focuses on Sikander's observations of a variety of insects and other creatures that surround her. Fascinated by nature since childhood, and more particularly since moving to her current home, the artist began experimenting with making birds in her medium of choice - paper. The paper, according to her, mimics nature in its versatility - soft, stiff, malleable and flexible, almost like wings, feathers and antennae. In some of her works, Sikander delves deeper into her engagement with her subjects, deconstructing, and even abstracting the individual elements of the bird or insect that she is recording." -- TARQ web site.

=500  \\$a"New world chronicles of an old world colour -- an exhibition of Ronny Sen's photographs is presented by The Polish Institute in New Delhi in collaboration with Latitude 28. This exhibition is a partner event of Delhi Photo Festival 2015. An exploration of melancholia, 'New world chronicles of an old world colour' is Ronny Sen's recent work created during the photographer's art residency stay in Gdańsk City Gallery, Poland earlier this year. 'Last winter, I spent three weeks in Poland in an old city called Gdańsk at the mouth of the Motława River. While there, I often thought of how it shared with my home city and state the many burdens of a communist past. This serendipitous connection became the locus of my attempts to connect to a place I was otherwise a stranger to. I was deeply inspired by Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Kieślowski's seminal work 'Three Colors Trilogy'. Taking a cue from his film, I wanted to react to everything that was going on around me, through individual shades. I had my own baggage because I came from Calcutta where the communists had ruled for the past three decades. I failed terribly; the colours in my memory were different from what I was encountering here. Soon disillusioned, I wasn't sure what I was looking for anymore. I sought out every glimpse of the accidental flare of hues, looking in and out, unnoticed and unseen. Capturing colours, seeking them out and arranging them in order would reveal meaning, I had thought. But what I ended up photographing were mundane things, seemingly regular, even banal, which only furthered the obscurity I had meant to resolve in the very beginning. In the strange and melancholic Polish winter, I grappled anew with the fading of the left and of red --the colour which had been its most enduring symbol in the past. Desolate, I looked thus for its chance traces and eventually moved to other things, left behind unnoticed in crevices, there in the streets where Solidarity had once emerged," writes Ronny Sen." -- TARQ web site.

Aiming to reinforce this friendship, the exhibition connects creative minds from fields as diverse as contemporary Indian art and Swiss waste management and technology. Cutting across these disciplines, the exhibition provides a platform for the exchange of innovative ideas and pioneering discoveries in both fields. The title, Waste Land, uses 'waste' as a generic term, covering a wide range of synonyms such as trash, garbage, refuse, junk, debris. It implies 'waste' as the verb that designates excessive squandering and the luxury our consumerist society has to do so. The title also refers to a deserted land, devastated by the depletion of resources through the sheer abundance of waste. Since the beginning of cultural history, waste has been an integral part of the functioning of socio-economic systems, whose evolution has culminated in the process of industrialization. In past decades, waste, long considered as something worthless to be discarded, has in many ways achieved the status of a sought-after raw material. Converted into a commodity through the process of recycling, waste is reinserted into the economic cycle, entering a new value chain. Pioneering efforts in countries such as Switzerland result in high technologies, promoting methods of waste treatment and resource efficiency that counteract the fallouts of our wasteful society." -- TARQ web site.

Working primarily with the mediums of gouache and ink on paper, Rithika creates elaborate and poetic mosaics of myths that seek to thread together a plethora of histories across time and space. Water forms a key motif in this body of work. Talking about her choice of subject, Rithika says -"Living in Barcelona, I have been profoundly affected by the refugee crisis which has spurred mass migrations across the Mediterranean Sea from Syria, Turkey and North Africa. The sea right at my door step is very quickly becoming the sea of the dead. With this in mind, it is important to remember that water also dilutes. To resolve a conflict between cultures, mixing and allowing two cultures to each be diluted by an influx of the other is key to the survival of both. This clash preserves rather than destroys the original cultures. I explore and examine the role water and migration routes play in this clash of cultures and how this leads to the development of a third, stronger culture." The exhibition will be accompanied by an essay written by Skye Arundhati Thomas." -- TARQ web site.

=500  \\$a"95 Mani Villa curated by Amit Mehra, is a personal memoir between a grandfather, Dhanji Anklesaria and his grandson, Zishaan Akbar Latif. This is the first time that this narrative will be seen in its entirety in Mumbai. These fleeting moments were captured in the last three years of Dhanji's life, and allowed Zishaan an opportunity to probe and understand this larger than life personality in his family. Zishaan intends to use this exhibition to create a surreal and cinematic experience for the audience through his photographs; flooding their senses with nostalgia, happiness and empathy. Zishaan creates a very intimate space for his viewers where they can have their own unique understanding of his relationship with his grandfather. 95 Mani Villa hopes to invoke curiosity and let people see that photography can be very personal. Zishaan works with the idea that it is sometimes the small, seemingly insignificant moments in our lives that are indeed the most important. Zishaan feels fortunate to be a photographer and be able to document some of these intimate experiences.

=500  \\$a"The third hand is an exhibition aimed at initial exploration of an interdisciplinary approach to art making for this group of artists, through active seeking of transcultural and rhizomatic links with the community of people, artist friends that surround them. With the intention of creating long term associations and understanding of the themes and the people within and outside of their art, the artists of this group show reach out of their internal space and directly address histories that make their personal narratives. The third hand takes on many forms, the literal addition of a collaborative partner, nuances of historical, socio-economical influences that become part of the work of art or an exchange of ideas, skills, techniques between artists. In the stories that these works tell we relive the idea of collective thought, in the words of Carl Jung, "We shall probably get nearest to the truth if we think of the conscious and personal psyche as resting upon the broad basis of an inherited and universal psychic disposition which is as such unconscious, and that our personal psyche bears the same relation to the collective psyche as the individual to society." The group of artists shown here, by working together with other artists, architects, the people who are part of their lives or by the medium they hold close, attempt to transpose lived experience and art with tactile and readable visuality. The artists in the show are practicing artists at the AQ@Priyasri - The Artist Studio. AQ@Priyasri - The Artist Studio is an art studio space at Vadodara, a city known for its artist community. The studio being an open space makes sharing time with other artists a possibility. It was therefore the perfect setting to this collaborative experience." -- Concept note.

=500  \\$a"The exhibition titled Archival Dialogues seeks to bring together a group of young artists from MSU Baroda whose practice responds to the manifold ruptures in political, social, ecological and personal spaces, looking through the lens of critical discourses on Archivization and Museumization. To be housed at Ferreira House, Khotachi Wadi, Mumbai, the exhibition seeks to primarily foreground a dialogue between the archival trend in contemporary art theory and praxis, and a largely forgotten fragment of colonial history trapped in this hamlet at the very heart of urban South Mumbai. The houses with colonial Portuguese architecture hearken back to an era when the race to colonization swept over the seas of this port-city. The East Indian Catholic community have spent over five-generations in the archaic bungalows at Khotachi Wadi, named after Khota, a local Maharashtrian Hindu from whom the plot of land was bought. One such bungalow, now belonging to designer James Ferreira, is the site for our exhibition. The selection of artists is based on the notion of an archival perfomative approach adopted by them to different ends to produce art-works for aesthetic consumption. For each of these artists, the relationship between 'fine-art' and craftsmanship becomes extremely important in understanding their diverse methods to a quasi-scientific museum display. In a post-modern rhizomatic, the multiplicities of re-interpretation, re-iteration and re-presentation are sought to be explored in a dialectical engagement with the bungalow's ornate interiors and the private collection of curios, thereby re-addressing the community's long historical presence in a cosmopolitan locale." -- Concept note.
